Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning

Breast cancer remains a critical health concern, with early detection being essential for successful treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying breast cancer cases as either benign or malignant based on clinical data. This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes various features extracted from imaging, such as the radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and symmetry of cell nuclei.

Dataset and Preprocessing

The dataset provides key measurements for each cell nucleus, which are instrumental in predicting cancer severity. Preprocessing involved handling any missing values, normalizing the data for model consistency, and exploring correlations between features. These steps ensured that our model received a clean, well-prepared dataset for optimal performance.

Modeling Approach

Several machine learning algorithms were considered, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, to identify the most effective classification method. By training and testing these models on the data, we could compare their predictive accuracy and performance across metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results and Evaluation

Our final model achieved a high accuracy, effectively distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. Key metrics like precision and recall were carefully monitored, ensuring that the model minimizes both false positives and false negatives. The selected model demonstrates robustness, making it a valuable tool for aiding in the early detection of breast cancer.

Conclusion

This breast cancer classification model showcases the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics. By automating the analysis of diagnostic features, it provides a reliable second opinion that could assist healthcare professionals in early cancer detection. Future improvements could include expanding the dataset, refining feature selection, and deploying the model for real-time diagnostic support.
